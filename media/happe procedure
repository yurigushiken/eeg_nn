Here are the exact answers to provide for each prompt.

    Enter the path to the folder containing the dataset(s):

        Answer: D:\EEG_Analysis_45Hz\raw_data_renamed

    Select an option: raw = ... reprocess = ...

        Answer: raw

    Load pre-existing set of input parameters? [Y/N]

        Answer: N

    Low density data? [Y/N]

        Answer: N

    Data type: rest = ... task = ...

        Answer: task

    Performing event-related potential (ERP) analysis? [Y/N]

        Answer: Y

    Enter the task onset tags... input "done" when finished.

        Answer 1: Tgts
        Answer 2: done

    File format: ... 5 = .mff ...

        Answer: 5

    Acquisition layout type: ... 2 = EGI HydroCel ...

        Answer: 2

    Number of channels:

        Answer: 128

    Do you have additional type fields besides "code"? [Y/N]

        Answer: N

    Select channels of interest: all = ...

        Answer: all

    Frequency of electrical (line) noise in Hz:

        Answer: 60

    Are there any additional frequencies... to reduce? [Y/N]

        Answer: N

    Line noise reduction method: cleanline = ...

        Answer: cleanline

    Use legacy or default line noise reduction?

        Answer: default

    Resample data? [Y/N]

        Answer: N

    Enter low-pass filter, in Hz:

        Answer: 45
        (Note: This remains the same. The paper confirms this is a good choice for EEGNet.)

    Enter high-pass filter, in Hz:

        Answer: 1.0
        Reasoning (The Change): Based on the Kessler et al. finding that higher HPF cutoffs consistently improve decoding. 1.0 Hz is a strong but very safe choice that aggressively removes slow drift.

    Choose a filter: fir = ...

        Answer: fir

    Perform bad channel detection? [Y/N]

        Answer: Y
        Reasoning: This is kept ON, as per the consultant's advice for Pipeline B. Genuinely broken channels should always be handled.

    Run bad channel detection before or after wavelet...?

        Answer: before

    Use ECGone...? [Y/N]

        Answer: N

    Method of wavelet thresholding:

        Answer: default

    Threshold rule for wavelet thresholding:

        Answer: soft
        Reasoning: The consultant advises keeping minimal artifact correction. Wavelet-ICA is the main tool HAPPE uses for this. We keep it on its most gentle setting (default and soft) to remove significant non-neural noise while being less aggressive than other steps.

    Segment data? [Y/N]

        Answer: Y

    Segment start, in MILLISECONDS...

        Answer: -100

    Segment end, in MILLISECONDS...

        Answer: 600

    Offset delay, in MILLISECONDS...

        Answer: 17

    Perform baseline correction...? [Y/N]

        Answer: Y
        Reasoning: Kept ON. The Kessler paper found this specifically increased performance for EEGNet.

    ...baseline segment begins:

        Answer: -100

    ...baseline segment ends:

        Answer: 0

    Interpolate the specific channels data... within each segment? [Y/N]

        Answer: Y

    Perform segment rejection? [Y/N]

        Answer: N
        Reasoning (The Change): This is a key part of the "Minimal" artifact correction strategy for Pipeline B. We are turning OFF the aggressive amplitude-based trial rejection and relying only on the bad channel detection and wavelet-ICA steps.

    Re-reference data? [Y/N]

        Answer: Y

    Does your data contain a flatline... reference channel? [Y/N]

        Answer: N

    Re-referencing type:

        Answer: average

    Format to save processed data:

        Answer: 1

    Run HAPPE with visualizations? [Y/N]

        Answer: N
