# ✅ Quick Visual Check - Round 2 Fixes

**Open each figure and verify these specific fixes:**

---

## 📊 Figure 1: Pipeline

### Look for:
- ✅ **4 boxes in Optuna section** (not 3)
- ✅ Box labels: "Stage 1: Architecture", "Stage 2: Sanity Check", "Stage 3: Recipe", "Stage 4: Augmentation"
- ✅ Clear space between "Objective:" text and downward arrow
- ✅ No arrow overlapping the objective text

### Zoom in on:
- The Optuna section (middle of figure)
- The italic objective text below the 4 stage boxes
- The arrow going down from the Optuna section

---

## 📊 Figure 2: Nested CV

### Look for:
- ✅ "Fold 1", "Fold 12", "Fold 24" labels are **left of the green/pink boxes**
- ✅ "Inner Fold 1-5" labels are **left of the green/yellow boxes**
- ✅ Subject IDs: S02, S03, S04, S05, S08, ... (not S1, S2, S3...)

### Zoom in on:
- Left edge of "Fold 12" and "Fold 24" rows (check no overlap with S02 box)
- Left edge of all "Inner Fold" rows (check labels don't touch boxes)

---

## 📊 Figure 7: Per-Subject Forest

### Look for:
- ✅ Y-axis shows: S02, S03, S04, S05, S08, ... S33 (not S1-S24)
- ✅ White stats box is in **upper left corner** (not bottom)
- ✅ "Trials" column header has space above the n= values
- ✅ Legend on right side has adequate spacing

### Zoom in on:
- Y-axis labels (should show S02-S33 with gaps)
- Upper left corner (stats box should be there)
- Right side "Trials" area (should have breathing room)

---

## 📊 Figure 5: Learning Curves

### Look for:
- ✅ Bottom caption "Mean across 24 outer folds..." is **well below Panel D**
- ✅ Clear white space between caption and x-axis label "Epoch"

### Zoom in on:
- Bottom of figure (caption should have generous space)

---

## 📊 Figure 6: Permutation

### Look for:
- ✅ Bottom caption "Permutation test..." is **well below both panels**
- ✅ Clear white space between caption and x-axis labels

### Zoom in on:
- Bottom of figure (caption should have generous space)

---

## 📊 Figure 10: Performance Box Plots

### Look for:
- ✅ Bottom caption "Box plots show median..." is **well below all 4 panels**
- ✅ Clear white space between caption and panel labels

### Zoom in on:
- Bottom of figure (especially under Panels C and D)
- Caption should be much lower than before

---

## 🔍 Visual Inspection Tips

### **Step 1: View at 100% Zoom**
- Don't rely on thumbnail views
- Zoom to actual size (100%) in your viewer

### **Step 2: Check Each Corner**
- Top left, top right
- Bottom left, bottom right
- Any annotation boxes or legends

### **Step 3: Check Margins**
- Left margin (fold/subject labels)
- Right margin (legends, trial counts)
- Bottom margin (captions)
- Top margin (titles)

### **Step 4: Check Overlaps**
- Text on text
- Text on lines
- Text on boxes
- Arrows on text

---

## ✅ Quick Pass/Fail

### **PASS Criteria:**
- All text readable without overlap
- Generous white space around captions
- Labels positioned clearly outside plot areas
- No arrows or lines obscuring text

### **FAIL Criteria:**
- Any text touching other text
- Captions touching axis labels
- Labels overlapping data boxes
- Arrows covering text

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

**All figures should:**
- Look professionally spaced
- Have "breathing room" around every element
- Be immediately readable without squinting
- Pass the "print test" (looks good on paper)

## 📝 What Changed from Round 1?

### **Figure 1:**
- Now shows 4 stages (was 3)
- More vertical space in Optuna section
- Objective text moved down
- Arrow repositioned lower

### **Figure 2:**
- Fold labels moved left of boxes
- Inner Fold labels moved left of boxes
- Extended x-axis for label space

### **Figure 7:**
- Real subject IDs (S02-S33)
- Stats box moved to upper left
- More space for "Trials" column
- Legend positioned better

### **Figures 5, 6, 10:**
- Bottom captions moved much further down
- Increased bottom margins significantly
- Maximum clearance from plot elements

## 🚀 If Everything Looks Good:

✅ **You're ready for submission!**

Next steps:
1. Archive these versions (they're publication-perfect)
2. Update manuscript to mention 4-stage optimization
3. Write figure legends
4. Submit!

## 🚨 If You See Any Issues:

1. Take a screenshot of the issue
2. Describe exactly what's overlapping
3. Share with your team
4. We can fine-tune further if needed
