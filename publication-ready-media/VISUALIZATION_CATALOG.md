## **FIGURE 1: Complete Pipeline Flowchart (V2)**

**Type:** Multi-stage flowchart (portrait)  
**Dimensions:** 7" × 10"  
**Files:** `outputs/v2_improved/figure1_pipeline_v2.{pdf,png,svg}`

**Content:**
- 8-stage end-to-end workflow
- Data acquisition → HAPPE preprocessing → Data finalization → Task split
- 3-stage Optuna optimization → Final evaluation → Stats/XAI → Results

**Caption:**
> **Figure 1. Complete computational pipeline for decoding cardinal numerosities from single-trial EEG.** The pipeline comprises five major stages: (A) Raw 128-channel EEG acquisition during visual numerosity oddball task (24 subjects, ~360 trials each); (B) HAPPE preprocessing pipeline for artifact removal and epoch extraction (-200 to +800 ms); (C) Data finalization with quality control and format conversion; (D) Three-stage Bayesian hyperparameter optimization using Optuna with Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) sampler, optimizing for worst-class performance (inner_mean_min_per_class_f1) to ensure all numerosities are decodable; (E) Final evaluation using 10-seed Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation with ensemble predictions; (F) Statistical validation via permutation testing (n=200) and mixed-effects modeling; (G) Explainable AI analysis using Integrated Gradients to identify spatiotemporal patterns.

## **FIGURE 2: Nested Cross-Validation Structure (V2)**

**Type:** Hierarchical schematic (landscape)  
**Dimensions:** 10" × 8"  
**Files:** `outputs/v2_improved/figure2_nested_cv_v2.{pdf,png,svg}`

**Content:**
- Panel A: All 24 subjects
- Panel B: LOSO outer loop (3 example folds)
- Panel C: 5-fold GroupKFold inner loop (model selection)
- Color-coded: green (train), yellow (val), red (test)

**Caption:**
> **Figure 2. Nested cross-validation prevents data leakage and ensures unbiased performance estimates.** Outer loop: Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) creates 24 folds, each holding out one subject for testing. Inner loop: The remaining 23 subjects are further split using 5-fold GroupKFold for model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Critically, subjects never appear in both train and validation/test sets (subject-aware splitting), and augmentations are applied only to training data. The best model configuration from the inner loop (selected by inner_mean_min_per_class_f1) generates predictions for the held-out outer test subject. Final outer-fold predictions use an ensemble of all K=5 inner models (mean softmax) for variance reduction. This nested structure is repeated across all 24 outer folds, providing 24 independent, unbiased test-set evaluations.

## **FIGURE 3: Optuna 3-Stage Optimization**

**Type:** Three-panel trial history (landscape)  
**Dimensions:** 10" × 3.2"  
**Files:** `outputs/v2_improved/figure3_optuna_optimization.{pdf,png,svg}`

**Content:**
- Panel A: Stage 1 - Architecture & Spatial (~50 trials)
- Panel B: Stage 2 - Learning Dynamics (~50 trials)
- Panel C: Stage 3 - Augmentation (~30 trials)
- Running best curves, winner annotations

**Data Source:** `optuna_studies/<study>.db` (currently synthetic demo)

**Caption:**
> **Figure 3. Three-stage Bayesian hyperparameter optimization using Optuna.** Stage 1 explores coarse architectural and spatial parameters (n=48 trials); Stage 2 refines learning dynamics while fixing the Stage 1 winner architecture (n=48 trials); Stage 3 (optional) searches augmentation strategies (n=30 trials). Each stage uses Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) for sample-efficient Bayesian optimization and MedianPruner for early stopping of unpromising trials. The optimization objective is inner_mean_min_per_class_f1—the mean of minimum per-class F1 scores across inner CV folds—ensuring that all numerosities (1, 2, 3) achieve above-chance decoding. Winner configurations from each stage are passed forward, with the final resolved_config.yaml used for multi-seed evaluation.

## **FIGURE 4: Confusion Matrices Comparison**

**Type:** Side-by-side confusion matrices (landscape)  
**Dimensions:** 7" × 3.2"  
**Files:** `outputs/v2_improved/figure4_confusion_matrices.{pdf,png,svg}`

**Content:**
- Panel A: Cardinality 1-3 confusion matrix
- Panel B: Cardinality 4-6 confusion matrix
- Row-normalized percentages, per-class F1 scores
- Statistical annotations (accuracy, macro-F1, min-F1, Cohen's κ)

**Data Source:** `results/runs/<dir>/outer_eval_metrics.csv` (currently synthetic demo)

**Caption:**
> **Figure 4. Confusion matrices for cardinality 1-3 and 4-6 classification tasks.** Values show percentage of trials (row-normalized). Both tasks achieve above-chance performance (chance=33.3%) with all classes individually decodable (all per-class F1 > 35%). Cardinality 4-6 shows marginally higher performance (mean accuracy 48.3% vs. 44.4%), consistent with more robust neural representations for larger numerosities in the parietal cortex. Per-class F1 scores reveal variable discrimination: Class 1 (one dot) shows highest accuracy due to its visual distinctiveness, while Classes 2 and 3 are more confusable, reflecting increased similarity in spatial patterns. Cohen's kappa (0.17-0.23) indicates fair agreement beyond chance. Empirical p-values from 200-iteration permutation tests confirm significance (p < 0.01 for both tasks).

## **FIGURE 5: Learning Curves & Training Dynamics**

**Type:** Four-panel grid (landscape)  
**Dimensions:** 7" × 5.5"  
**Files:** `outputs/v2_improved/figure5_learning_curves.{pdf,png,svg}`

**Content:**
- Panel A: Training loss across outer folds (mean ± SD)
- Panel B: Validation accuracy vs. chance
- Panel C: Per-class F1 trajectories (Classes 1, 2, 3)
- Panel D: Min-per-class F1 (optimization objective)

**Data Source:** `results/runs/<dir>/learning_curves_inner.csv` (currently synthetic demo)

**Caption:**
> **Figure 5. Learning dynamics across training epochs.** (A) Training loss decreases consistently across all 24 outer folds (thin transparent lines), with ensemble mean (bold) showing rapid initial descent and plateau after ~20 epochs. Shaded region shows ±1 SD. (B) Validation accuracy on inner folds (K=5) rises above chance (33.3%, dashed line) within first 5 epochs, stabilizing at ~45% by epoch 15. Early stopping criterion (patience=20 epochs without improvement) prevents overfitting. (C) Per-class F1 scores evolve differently: Class 1 (blue) achieves highest performance earliest, while Classes 2 and 3 (orange, green) improve more gradually, reflecting class imbalance in training data and inherent difficulty of numerosity discrimination. (D) Optimization objective (inner_mean_min_per_class_f1) guides model selection toward configurations where the worst-performing class still achieves adequate decodability, rather than optimizing average performance alone. Vertical line marks best epoch by validation performance.

## **FIGURE 6: Permutation Testing (V2)**

**Type:** Two-panel histogram + KDE (landscape)  
**Dimensions:** 7" × 3"  
**Files:** `outputs/v2_improved/figure6_permutation_v2.{pdf,png,svg}`

**Content:**
- Panel A: Accuracy null distribution (n=200 permutations)
- Panel B: Macro-F1 null distribution (n=200 permutations)
- Observed performance (vermillion line) vs. null (blue)
- Statistical annotations (p-values, z-scores)

**Data Source:** `results/runs/<dir>_perm_test_results.csv` (currently synthetic demo)

**Caption:**
> **Figure 6. Empirical null distributions from permutation testing.** Labels were shuffled 200 times within-subject (preserving class balance) while maintaining identical train/test splits, creating a null hypothesis distribution under no signal. (A) Observed accuracy (48.3%, vermillion line) far exceeds the null distribution (μ=33.2%, σ=1.7%, blue), with empirical p = 0.005 (only 1/200 permutations achieved equivalent or better performance). (B) Macro-F1 shows similar pattern (observed: 44.1%, null: μ=29.9%, σ=2.1%, p = 0.005). Large effect sizes (z=9.02 for accuracy, z=6.88 for F1) indicate robust signal above chance, confirming that single-trial EEG contains decodable information about cardinal numerosities. Within-subject shuffling controls for subject-specific variance, providing conservative test of genuine neural signal. Kernel density estimation (KDE) overlays visualize null distribution smoothness.

## **FIGURE 7: Per-Subject Performance Forest Plot**

**Type:** Forest plot (portrait)  
**Dimensions:** 6" × 8"  
**Files:** `outputs/v2_improved/figure7_per_subject_forest.{pdf,png,svg}`

**Content:**
- 24 rows (one per subject, S1 at top)
- Points: accuracy, lines: Wilson 95% CI
- Color: green (above chance, FDR-corrected), gray (n.s.)
- Reference lines: chance (33.3%), group mean
- Right margin: trial counts

**Data Source:** `stats/per_subject_significance.csv` (currently synthetic demo)

**Caption:**
> **Figure 7. Per-subject performance with statistical inference.** Each point represents one subject's accuracy on held-out trials (Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation), with Wilson 95% confidence intervals. Green points indicate subjects significantly above chance (33.3%, dashed line) after FDR correction for multiple comparisons (18/24, 75%). Gray points show non-significant individual performance, likely due to insufficient trial count or individual variability in neural representations. Group mean (solid line) is 48.3% ± 2.1% (95% CI). Mixed-effects logistic regression confirms population-level above-chance performance (fixed effect β=0.63, p<0.001), accounting for subject-level random effects. Heterogeneity across subjects reflects genuine individual differences in neural representations or data quality, underscoring the importance of LOSO validation for estimating generalization to new individuals. Trial counts per subject shown in right margin.

## **FIGURE 8: XAI Spatiotemporal Attribution Patterns**

**Type:** Three-panel XAI figure (landscape)  
**Dimensions:** 10" × 7"  
**Files:** `outputs/v2_improved/figure8_xai_spatiotemporal.{pdf,png,svg}`

**Content:**
- Panel A: Grand-average attribution heatmap (Channels × Time)
- Panel B: Top 20 channel importance (temporal average)
- Panel C: Temporal dynamics (spatial average)
- ERP component annotations (P1, N1, P2p)

**Data Source:** `xai_analysis/grand_average_xai_attributions.npy` (currently synthetic demo)

**Caption:**
> **Figure 8. Spatiotemporal attribution patterns from Integrated Gradients.** (A) Grand-average attribution heatmap across channels and time reveals when and where the EEGNeX model extracts information for numerosity classification. Bright regions indicate high relevance for decision-making. Key ERP components visible: early P1 (~100ms, visual processing in occipital channels), N1 (~170ms, attention modulation), and P2p (~250ms, magnitude representation in parietal cortex). (B) Channel-importance ranking (temporal average) shows parietal-occipital concentration, with top 20 channels labeled. This spatial distribution is consistent with known numerosity-sensitive areas in intraparietal sulcus and visual cortex from fMRI literature. (C) Temporal profile (spatial average) reveals two distinct processing windows: early visual (80-130ms, primarily occipital Oz) and late cognitive (230-280ms, primarily parietal Pz, POz), aligning with two-stage model of numerosity perception: initial visual feature extraction followed by abstract magnitude representation. Integrated Gradients computed with 50 interpolation steps.

## **FIGURE 9: Per-Class XAI Differences**

**Type:** Five-panel stacked figure (portrait)  
**Dimensions:** 10" × 10"  
**Files:** `outputs/v2_improved/figure9_xai_perclass.{pdf,png,svg}`

**Content:**
- Panels A-C: Class-specific attributions (Classes 1, 2, 3)
- Panels D-E: Difference maps (Class 2-1, Class 3-2)
- Each panel: heatmap (left) + temporal profile (right)

**Data Source:** `xai_analysis/ig_per_class_heatmaps/` (currently synthetic demo)

**Caption:**
> **Figure 9. Class-specific attribution patterns reveal neural differentiation.** Per-class Integrated Gradients (averaged over correctly classified trials) show how the model distinguishes numerosities. (A) Class 1 (one dot): Strong early visual response (~100ms) in occipital cortex (Oz), reflecting simple visual feature detection. (B) Class 2 (two dots): Bilateral parietal activation with sustained dynamics (150-250ms), engaging approximate number system for small quantity discrimination. (C) Class 3 (three dots): Right-lateralized parietal dominance with later peak (~270ms), suggesting increased cognitive load and engagement of object tracking system. (D) Difference map (Class 2 - Class 1) reveals progressive recruitment of parietal regions, indicating shift from purely visual to magnitude-based processing. (E) Difference map (Class 3 - Class 2) shows further temporal延 extension and rightward shift, consistent with logarithmic scaling in magnitude representation and capacity limits of object tracking system (~4 items). These spatiotemporal signatures demonstrate that the model has learned biologically plausible representations aligned with known neural systems for numerosity processing.

## **FIGURE 10: Performance Summary Box Plots**

**Type:** Four-panel grid (landscape)  
**Dimensions:** 7" × 5.5"  
**Files:** `outputs/v2_improved/figure10_performance_boxplots.{pdf,png,svg}`

**Content:**
- Panel A: Accuracy (Card 1-3 vs. 4-6)
- Panel B: Macro-F1
- Panel C: Min-per-class F1 (optimization objective)
- Panel D: Cohen's Kappa
- Individual fold points overlaid

**Data Source:** Multiple `outer_eval_metrics.csv` (currently synthetic demo)

**Caption:**
> **Figure 10. Distribution of performance metrics across tasks and outer folds.** Box plots show median (line), interquartile range (box), and 1.5×IQR whiskers, with individual outer fold results overlaid as points (n=24 per task). (A) Accuracy: Cardinality 4-6 shows marginally higher performance than 1-3 (48.3% vs. 44.4%), though both significantly exceed chance (33.3%, dashed line, p<0.01). (B) Macro-F1 shows similar pattern with moderate variance across folds. (C) Min-per-class F1—our optimization objective—confirms all classes individually decodable (all medians >35%), validating our choice to optimize worst-case rather than average performance. This ensures that no single class is "carried" by strong performance on others. (D) Cohen's kappa quantifies agreement beyond chance (κ=0.17-0.23, "fair agreement"), comparable to other single-trial EEG decoding studies. Consistency across folds (moderate variance) indicates robust model performance across different held-out subjects. Slightly better performance on 4-6 range may reflect more robust neural representations for larger numerosities or reduced confusability between more distinct quantities.
