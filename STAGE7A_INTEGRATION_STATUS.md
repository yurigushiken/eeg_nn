# Stage 7A Integration Status

**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE - Manual cleanup needed

---

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. **Created `code/training/outer_loop.py`** ✅
   - 900+ lines
   - `OuterFoldOrchestrator` class fully implemented
   - Handles one complete outer fold orchestration
   - Includes all inner loop logic, evaluation, plotting

2. **Added imports to `training_runner.py`** ✅
   - Imported `OuterFoldOrchestrator`

3. **Initialized orchestrators in `run()`** ✅
   - Lines 533-544: Created `inner_trainer`, `outer_evaluator`, `fold_orchestrator`

4. **Started outer loop replacement** ✅
   - Lines 560-647: Added call to `fold_orchestrator.run_fold()`
   - Added result accumulation code

---

## ❌ What Still Needs to Be Done

### **Critical Issue: Old Code Not Fully Removed**

**Lines 650-1081 (432 lines)** of the OLD outer fold loop body are still present!

These lines contain:
- Old inner K-fold setup (line 650-656)
- Old inner fold loop (lines 695-823)
- Old inner aggregation (lines 825-849)
- Old best model selection (lines 851-903)
- Old outer evaluation setup (lines 905-947)
- Old metrics computation (lines 954-1006)
- Old plotting logic (lines 1008-1076)
- Old fold record append (lines 1079-1080)

**These lines MUST be deleted!**

---

## 🔧 Manual Fix Required

### Step 1: Open `code/training_runner.py`

### Step 2: Delete lines 650-1081 (entire block)

The file should have:
```python
Lines 647-649:
            # Fold complete (logging handled by orchestrator)

        # Overall metrics
        mean_acc = float(np.mean(fold_accs)) if fold_accs else 0.0
        ...
```

**After deletion:**
- Line 647: `# Fold complete...`
- Line 648: blank
- Line 649: `# Overall metrics`
- Line 650: `mean_acc = ...`

### Step 3: Verify the change

After deletion, the outer loop should be clean:
```python
for fold, (tr_idx, va_idx) in enumerate(outer_pairs):
    if self.cfg.get("max_folds") is not None and fold >= int(self.cfg["max_folds"]):
        break
    
    # Get predefined inner splits
    predefined_inner = ...
    
    # Run complete outer fold using OuterFoldOrchestrator
    fold_result = fold_orchestrator.run_fold(...)
    
    # Update global step
    global_step = fold_result["new_global_step"]
    
    # Collect results
    test_subjects = fold_result["test_subjects"]
    ...
    
    # Accumulate results
    fold_accs.append(metrics["acc"])
    ...
    
    # Build outer metrics row for CSV
    outer_metrics_rows.append({...})
    
    # Fold complete

# Overall metrics (loop ends here)
mean_acc = ...
```

## 📊 Expected Outcome After Fix

### Before (current):
- `training_runner.py`: 1,324 lines
- Outer loop: ~740 lines (huge!)
- Status: ❌ Monolithic

### After (target):
- `training_runner.py`: ~650 lines
- Outer loop: ~90 lines (orchestration only)
- Status: ✅ Modular

### Line Reduction:
- Remove: 432 lines of duplicate old code
- Net reduction: ~670 lines from original 1,792

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

After manual deletion:

1. **Check line count:**
   ```powershell
   (Get-Content code/training_runner.py | Measure-Object -Line).Lines
   ```
   Should be: ~650 lines

2. **Check imports:**
   ```powershell
   grep "from .training.outer_loop import" code/training_runner.py
   ```
   Should find the import

3. **Check for duplicates:**
   ```powershell
   grep "Initialize inner trainer" code/training_runner.py
   ```
   Should find ZERO matches (all moved to OuterFoldOrchestrator)

4. **Run quick syntax check:**
   ```powershell
   python -m py_compile code/training_runner.py
   ```
   Should have no syntax errors

## 🎯 Why This Matters

This is THE BIG REFACTORING - extracting the outer fold orchestration is the heart of Stage 7a. Once complete:

- ✅ `training_runner.py` becomes a true orchestrator
- ✅ Outer fold logic is encapsulated and testable
- ✅ Code is dramatically simpler (~650 vs 1,792 lines)
- ✅ Each fold is a clean, reusable operation

---

## 📝 Next Steps After Fix

1. ✅ Verify syntax (py_compile)
2. ✅ Check imports work
3. ✅ Run quick test with minimal config
4. ✅ Compare outputs to golden reference
5. ✅ Mark Stage 7a as COMPLETE
6. 🚀 Move to Stage 7b (final simplification)
